# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## Conception:

This website was created following along with the course content on the code institute. The ideas are not my own, but rather were copied in various steps from mark in the videos.
The languages used were HTML & CSS. I have not yet began earning any java script.

## Github/ Gitpod

The website was created on gitpod and can be seen in the corresponding github repository, in which you are reading this. I was not prepared to be so confused by github/gitpod.
### No Really!
The course has been easy and enjpyable up to this point. Learning and understanding github, and by extension gitpod, made me want to cry on several occassions. In the end after much trial and error...and repositories....and refreshes...and days...this section was completed and the website was deployed.

Look, it can only get easier...
